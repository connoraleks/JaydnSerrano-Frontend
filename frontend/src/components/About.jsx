                Hey! I'm Jaydn Serrano, a 22 year old photographer specializing in people, cars, animals and nature. 
                <br/>I got my first camera in high school and would shoot anything, and quickly fell in love with the process. 
                <br/>For me it is exciting to capture moments in time that are often overlooked in the bigger picture &#40;pun intended&#x29;. 
                <br/>Some things I enjoy doing in my free time include playing guitar, exercise, and quality time with family &amp; friends.
